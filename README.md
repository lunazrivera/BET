## Description

**BET** is an expense bill tracker. Most of expense trackers are cluttered with many features, therefore making them difficult to operate.

### Idea
With this in mind we embarked on creating an application that focuses on creating an ease of use experience for our users when it comes to managing theyâ€™re expenses.

## Future improvements
We are planning on rolling out adding additional features to the app. The following are some of the ideas we have at the moment:
-   Show user a reminder for upcoming bills.
    
-   Be able to take photo of a bill or receipt.
    
-   Create a interactive chart to show monthly expenditure on categories.
    
-   The possibility to link the application with a bank account an automate the expenses by looking at transaction history.
    
-   Resetting the progress bar (budget) every month
